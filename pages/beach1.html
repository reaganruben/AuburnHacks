                       In his attempt to find his wife, he is stunned by all of the beautiful French women. However, through the clouds of cigarette smoke, he was stunned to discover he was at a nude beach. Desperate to stay loyal to his beloved wife, Mr. Coconut rolls away as quickly as he can, only to find himself rolling onto Leonardo Dicaprio's yacht. He is swiftly picked up by a bartender who made the grave mistake of assuming he was the missing ingredient to a Pina Colada. Once he escaped, he rolls into the casting director of a new movie hat will be showing at the Cannes Film Festival. The casting director loved what Mr. Coconut was working with and hired him on the spot for his new remake of a new movie. Little did Mr. Coconut know, the movie that was being remade was Castaway... and he was playing the volleyball. None the less it allowed him to get some money for his next adventure.
