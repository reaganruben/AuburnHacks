                        A unique beach composed of small bits of colorful sea glass, terracotta pieces, and seashells, Glass Beach is a must-see tourist destination.

                        The unique sea glass started compiling after the 1906 earthquake struck San Francisco. The debris from collapsed buildings, wooden piers, and other garbage was bulldozed by local residents into the ocean. Rock formations along the coast trapped the debris and kept spitting it back to shore, where it would naturall get tumbled by waves and tidal motion. As the debris piles accumulated, they were burned, and the piles melted down into fire glass, a unique type of sea glass.
                    </p>
                    <p align = "justify">
                        Now Glass Beach has officially become part of MacKerricher State Park. All sea glass and resources are protected by state laws and tourists are prohibited from collecting sea glass from the beach.
